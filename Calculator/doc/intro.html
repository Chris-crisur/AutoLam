<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>When you type a lambda expression into the input field labeled "as"
and press Enter, the program will display the sequence of reductions it
performs in simplifying your expression in the output text area below.
For example, type the following
in the wide text area at the window's top.
<blockquote>
<tt>(\x.* x x) (- 3 1)</tt>
</blockquote>
On most computers, when you type the backslash, a lambda will appear.
Thus you'll actually see the following.
<blockquote>
<tt>(<img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x) (- 3 1)</tt>
</blockquote>
The <tt><img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x</tt> portion of this expression represents a function
that takes a parameter <em>x</em> and returns the value of <em>x</em> *
<em>x</em>. This expression says to pass the value of <tt>- 3 1</tt>
as the parameter into this function.
(Note that functions are written using prefix notation: You place the
multiplication sign first, followed by the two arguments.)</p>

<p>On pressing Enter, the program will display the following reductions
to arrive at an answer.
<blockquote>
<tt>(<img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x) (- 3 1)<br>
   = * (- 3 1) (- 3 1)<br>
   = * 2 2<br>
   = 4</tt>
</blockquote>
Thus, the program has computed an answer of 4.</p>

<p>You can define symbols to represent lambda expressions by typing the
symbol name into the "Define" field and the expression into the "as"
field before pressing Enter.
<blockquote>
Define <tt>sq</tt> as <tt><img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x</tt>
</blockquote>
The calculator will simplify the expression (in this case, it's already
simplified) and store it in its memory. If you reference the symbol
later, the calculator will substitute the expression in its place.
If you now ask the calculator to simplify
<tt>sq (- 3 1)</tt>, it will display the following reductions.
<blockquote>
<tt>sq (- 3 1)<br>
  = * (- 3 1) (- 3 1)<br>
  = * 2 2<br>
  = 4</tt>
</blockquote></p>
