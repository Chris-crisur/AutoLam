<h1>About the program</h1>

<p>The author of this program is Prof. Carl Burch, who you can contact
at <tt>cburch@cburch.com</tt>.
It was begun in Spring 2003 for students at
College of St Benedict and St John's University in Collegeville,
Minnesota.</p>

<p>If you find this program useful, the author would love to hear about
it: My name is Carl Burch, at <tt>cburch@cburch.com</tt>.
I will appreciate hearing from teachers at other institutions who
find it useful in their classes.</p>

<p>If you find any bugs, please let me know! I generally respond to bug
reports fairly quickly. If you think that a feature is missing that
would help the program immensely, I'm also curious.</p>

<p>Program (c) 2003, by Carl Burch. It is available through
