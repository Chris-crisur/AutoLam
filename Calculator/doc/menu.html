<strong>File</strong>
<blockquote>
The Import... and Export... items allow you to open and save all the
symbols currently defined into a file. (A separate page describes the <a

The Quit item allows you to exit the program.

<h2>Engine options</h2>

<strong>Maximum Reductions</strong>
<blockquote>
Some lambda expressions can never be completely simplified, such as the
following.
<center>
<tt>(<img src=lambda.gif>x.x x x) (<img src=lambda.gif>x.x x x)</tt>
</center>
To avoid eating up too many resources, the engine limits how many steps
it will perform before giving up.
You can customize how many steps this will take.</p>

<p>If you define a symbol to represent the result of an expression whose
simplification process required more steps than given, <em>Lambda
Calculator</em> will define the symbol as the <em>smallest</em> lambda
expression it found during the process.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Evaluation Order</strong>
<blockquote>
The intuitive way of applying an argument to a function is to
evaluate the argument before sending it into the function.
This is called the <em>applicative order</em> of evaluation
(also called <em>eager</em> or <em>call-by-value</em> evaluation).
The following illustrates how this works on one expression.
<blockquote>
<tt>(<img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x) (- 3 1)<br>
  = (<img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x) 2
  = * 2 2<br>
  = 4
</p></blockquote></p>

<p>By default, however, <em>Lambda Calculator</em> uses
<em>normal order</em>
(also called <em>lazy</em> or <em>call-by-name</em> evaluation).
In this system, an argument is
passed into a function without evaluation.
<blockquote>
<tt>(<img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x) (- 3 1)<br>
  = * (- 3 1) (- 3 1)<br>
  = * 2 2<br>
  = 4
</p></blockquote>
Here, we do not compute <tt>- 3 1</tt> until <em>after</em> it is passed
into the function. We only compute its value once it becomes needed -
which is why some people call it <em>lazy</em> evaluation.</p>

<p>Notice, however, that when the argument is finally evaluated, it
changes everywhere. Such an unevaluated argument is called a
<em>thunk</em>, and simplification applied to it applies everywhere.
If you select the "Normal Without Thunks" option, the program will
not perform this optimization. This will mean that arguments may be
evaluated multiple times, leading to more reductions.
<blockquote>
<tt>(<img src=lambda.gif>x.* x x) (- 3 1)<br>
  = * (- 3 1) (- 3 1)<br>
  = * 2 (- 3 1)<br>
  = * 2 2<br>
  = 4
</p></blockquote>
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Use Applied Calculus</strong>
<blockquote>
If selected (as it is by default), then <em>Lambda Calculator</em> will
include some built-in
functions as described on the <a href=language.html>Language page</a>.
This is convenient, but such built-in functions represent a sullying of
the pure lambda calculus.</p>

<p>If you unselect this option, <em>Lambda Calculus</em> uses the pure
lambda calculus.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Enable Eta Reductions</strong>
<blockquote>
If selected (the default), <em>Lambda Calculator</em>'s engine will
enable eta reductions, in which expressions of the form <tt><img src=lambda.gif>x.f x</tt>
reduce to simply <tt>f</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<h2>Printing options</h2>

<strong>Maximum Length</strong>
<blockquote>
The program can bound the number of characters displayed in an
lambda expression; by default, it bounds the length at 100 characters.
A bounded length makes the program run faster, because long expressions
take a long time to convert into strings, and because long lines slow
the text area in which the program prints.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Print Lambda Characters</strong>
<blockquote>
If selected (the default), <em>Lambda Calculator</em> will display
lambda characters, if the current font supports it.
Otherwise, the program will use a backslash to represent a lambda
character.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Show Intermediate Steps</strong>
<blockquote>
If selected (the default), <em>Lambda Calculator</em> will display each
step of the reduction as it is performed. Displaying these intermediate
steps slows the computation process significantly, however, and you
can turn it off by unselecting this option. In this case, only the
initial lambda expression and its final value are displayed.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Substitute Symbols</strong>
<blockquote>
If selected (the default), the program will attempt to represent any
subexpressions of a printed expression that match with a defined
symbol's value with the symbol instead.
This can lead to lambda expressions that are easier to read.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Vary Parentheses</strong>
<blockquote>
With this option selected (not the default), the program will
intersperse brackets and braces sometimes in place of parentheses.
(The specific system it uses is two parentheses, then a bracket, then
two parentheses, then a brace.)
For large expressions, this can help in determining which parentheses
match.
</p></blockquote>

<h2>Interface options</h2>

<strong>Font Size</strong>
<blockquote>
This sets the size of the characters displayed in the input and output
fields.
</p></blockquote>
<strong>Show Browser</strong>
<blockquote>
If selected (the default), the program displays a list of all currently
defined symbols at the left side of the window. Selecting an item from
this list displays the value associated with the symbol.
